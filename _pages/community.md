# Community / Support

## General

[Borderlands Mod Support](https://discord.gg/bXeqV8Ef9R) is the central discord server for modding support for any of the games.

## Borderlands 1

- The main community chat area for Borderlands 1 modding is the
  [Borderlands: Community Hangout](https://discord.gg/5pzGb6w) Discord, so
  definitely stop by there if you're interested in getting in to that scene.

- [Borderlands Mods Support](https://discord.gg/bXeqV8Ef9R) is a newer server
  started in November 2021.  The BL1 areas might be a little less populated
  than BL2/TPS/BL3, but it's growing.

## Borderlands 2/TPS/AoDK

- [Borderlands Mods Support](https://discord.gg/bXeqV8Ef9R) is a newer server
  started in November 2021 by Shadowevil, as a spin-off from Shadow's Evil Hideout,
  which had long been the main hub for BL2/TPS modding.

- There is a [PythonSDK Discord server](https://discord.gg/VJXtHvh). Most SDK mod
  discussion occurs in this server, as well as some talk about the development of
  the SDK itself.

- An [alternate community modding Discord server exists](https://discord.gg/x5uQjE6),
  which was started by Exotek, specifically geared towards BL2/TPS modding (though
  some BL1 talk most likely occurs there as well).

## Borderlands 3

Borderlands 3 modding is still in very early days, so expect there to be some hiccups
as more and more people start using the software and mods.  There are a few places
to go for help with doing BL3 hotfix modding, though:

- [Borderlands Mods Support](https://discord.gg/bXeqV8Ef9R) is a newer server
  started in November 2021 by Shadowevil, as a spin-off from Shadow's Evil Hideout,
  which had been the main hub for BL3 modding.

- The [B3HM Nexusmods Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands3/mods/244) can
  be used to report bugs or ask for help running it.

- A Discord server named [Borderlands 3 Modding](https://discord.gg/38sDVpE)
  has existed for awhile which has historically been more focused on item/savegame
  editing, but has some hotfix-mod-related chatter on it nowadays as well.

## Other / General

Other communities related to Borderlands modding:

- There's another [Borderlands Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/9dYYN6Y) available
  as well, which appears to have some modding chat on it, though the author of this page
  doesn't really know anything about it.  It appears to be a more general-purpose Borderlands
  Discord, and may have more presence for console users, as opposed to just PC.
