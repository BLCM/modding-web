# Writing Wonderlands Mods

Writing Wonderlands mods is essentially identical to our methods of writing
BL3 mods, so nearly all that advice still applies.  See the
[Writing BL3 Mods](/bl3-writing-mods/) page for more detailed information
about modding in that game.

There *is* a page on our main documentation wiki which lists out some
Wonderlands-specific information:
[Wonderlands Modding Info](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/wiki/Wonderlands-Modding-Info).

One invaluable resource to look at, of course, is existing hotfixes.  There's a few
places to look to take a look at those:

- The main [WL mod repository](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/wiki) contains a lot of
  known-working examples.
- Gearbox's official hotfixes have been being collected since very shortly after the
  game launch, at [the wlhotfixes repo](https://github.com/BLCM/wlhotfixes/).

Some other information about writing mods with the assistance of Python code (which
will actually be *easier* in many cases than doing it entirely by hand) can be
found [right at the main wlmods repository](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/blob/master/README-authors.md).
