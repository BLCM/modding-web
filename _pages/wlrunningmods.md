# Running Wonderlands Mods

Running mods in Wonderlands is basically identical to running Borderlands 3
mods.  As of August 28, 2022, B3HM has not yet been updated to support
Wonderlands (that will be coming in v1.0.2 in a little while), but a new
project by apple1417 called "Open Hotfix Loader" has been released to
load mods that way.

Since the information is otherwise identical between the two games, detailed
information can be found on the [Running BL3 Mods](/bl3-running-mods) page.
