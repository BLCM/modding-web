# Running Wonderlands Mods

Running mods in Wonderlands is basically identical to running Borderlands 3
mods, though as of October 26, 2022, OpenHotfixLoader is the only supported
method of doing so.  (v1.0.2 of B3HM is still forthcoming, which will add
in Wonderlands support.)

Since the information is otherwise identical between the two games, detailed
information can be found on the [Running BL3 Mods](/bl3-running-mods) page.
