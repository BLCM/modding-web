# Finding Wonderlands Mods

Right now, most available Wonderlands Hotfix mods are being distributed over Github,
similar to how BL3 mods have been released.  The *easiest* way to find mods is by
using the [WL ModCabinet Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/wiki).

## WL ModCabinet Wiki

The [WL ModCabinet Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/wiki) organizes all
the Wonderlands mods in the main github into categories which should be pretty easy
to click around to find what you're looking for.  For instance, you could click on
"Cheat Mods" on that page to arrive at the
[Movement Speed Cheats Extreme Improvements](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/wiki/Movement%20Speed%20Cheats%20-%20Extreme%20Improvements)
mod, which improves character speed by quite a lot.  From there, you'll see a header
which looks like this:

[![ModCabinet Header](/img/bl3modcabinet.png)](/img/bl3modcabinet.png)

To download the mod to your hard drive, you can right-click on the `Download from Github`
link and choose "Save Link As."  B3HM does not require you to download the mod,
if you don't want to, though!  You could instead right-click on `Download from Github`
and choose "Copy Link Location", and then add in that URL to B3HM's mod list.  That
way you'll always end up loading the most recent version of the mod.  OpenHotfixLoader
*does* currently require that you download the mod to your hard drive, though.

If you want to keep your collection of mods a little more stable, you might want to
download the files locally anyway, of course.

## Direct Github Access

You can also download WL mods directly from [the wlmods Github page](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods),
though they will be organized by author, rather than category.
When you browse to a `.wlhotfix` mod file you want to download, it will either
have a `Raw` button or a `Download` button, in the upper right hand corner of the
file's contents:

[![Raw Button](/img/github_raw.png)](/img/github_raw.png)

[![Download Button](/img/github_download.png)](/img/github_download.png)

Right-click on that button and choose `Save Link As...` to save the file to
your computer, or `Copy Link Location` to import it as a URL into B3HM instead.
