# Finding Wonderlands Mods

Right now, most available Wonderlands Hotfix mods are being distributed over Github,
similar to how BL3 mods have been released.  The *easiest* way to find mods is by
using the [WL ModCabinet Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/wiki).

## WL ModCabinet Wiki

The [WL ModCabinet Wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/wiki) organizes all
the Wonderlands mods in the main github into categories which should be pretty easy
to click around to find what you're looking for.  For instance, you could click on
"Cheat Mods" on that page to arrive at the
[Movement Speed Cheats Extreme Improvements](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/wiki/Movement%20Speed%20Cheats%20-%20Extreme%20Improvements)
mod, which improves character speed by quite a lot.  From there, you'll see a header
which looks like this:

When using OHL to run mods, you can either save the file locally to our hard drive,
or have it load the mod from the internet.  To save the file locally, right-click the
link and choose "Save Link As."  To have OHL load the file from the internet instead,
simply drag the link to your mods folder to create a shortcut.

## Direct Github Access

You can also download WL mods directly from [the wlmods Github page](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods),
though they will be organized by author, rather than category.
When you browse to a `.wlhotfix` mod file you want to download, it will either
have a `Raw` button or a `Download` button, in the upper right hand corner of the
file's contents:

[![Raw Button](/img/github_raw.png)](/img/github_raw.png)

[![Download Button](/img/github_download.png)](/img/github_download.png)

Right-click on that button and choose `Save Link As...` to save the file to
your computer, or `Copy Link Location` to import it as a URL into B3HM instead.
