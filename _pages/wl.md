# Tiny Tina's Wonderlands Modding

[![Wonderlands Steam Logo](/img/logo_wl.jpg)](/img/logo_wl.jpg)

As of late August, 2022, we finally have some user-friendly methods of
running Wonderlands mods.  The functionality we have now is roughly the
same as what we have for BL3, so any BL3 mod users/authors should feel
right at home.

We've arranged the Wonderlands Modding information here into a couple different
pages depending on what you're interested in doing.  Click through for
more info!

- [Running Mods](/wl-running-mods/): How to run Wonderlands mods,
  using one of a few different methods.
- [Finding Mods](/wl-finding-mods/): How to find Wonderlands mods to
  use in your game.
- [Writing Mods](/wl-writing-mods/): Most of the detailed information
  about writing mods is hosted elsewhere, but this page will at least
  give you some pointers to that information.

For support with running WL Hotfix mods, you can ask on the
[Modding Support Discord](https://discord.gg/bXeqV8Ef9R).
