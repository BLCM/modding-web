# About this repo

This repo is the source for http://borderlandsmodding.com/

Editing should be pretty straightforward:

- The links at the top of the page, and on the sidebar, are
  defined in `_data/navigation.yml`
- The links at the bottom of the page are defined in `_config.yml`
- Pages are in `_pages`; just follow how the other ones
  look.  Be sure to put a `permalink` up in the top like
  all the other current pages do
- Blog-like posts are kept in `_posts` - stick to the naming
  convention in there of `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`, and be sure to
  include a top-level heading (using markdown's `#`).

I'd personally intend for the blog-like posts to be primarily
about more major things that happen, rather than trying to detail
every little thing.  New releases of UCP or BLCMM should be
mentioned in there, for instance, and "exciting" things like
Borderlands Commander which open up new avenues of modding.  The
recent chaos with the BL2+TPS UHD packs would be another good
example of a case where a post might be a good idea, just to
have a summary URL to point users to.
