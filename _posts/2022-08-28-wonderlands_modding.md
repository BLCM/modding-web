# Tiny Tina's Wonderlands Modding

With the release of [apple1417's OpenHotfixLoader](/2022/08/28/openhotfixloader/),
we've now got a way of using hotfix mods with Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, like
we've been doing with Borderlands 3.  An update is planned for [c0dycode's
B3HM](/2020/12/24/modding_for_bl3/) which will add Wonderlands support, though
it'll probably be a few weeks before that's ready.

What would a mod loader be without mods to load, though?  Like with BL3, we've
set up a [Wonderlands ModCabinet](https://github.com/BLCM/wlmods/wiki/) to
categorize the available mods.  At the moment there's a little over 40 mods
available, including many ports of mods from Borderlands 3.  As more folks
start modding for Wonderlands, expect the ModCabinet to grow!  Some pointers
on browsing the wiki can be found on our [Finding Wonderlands Mods](/wl-finding-mods/)
page.

The [BL3 "Running Mods"](/bl3-running-mods/) page has some details on
running mods -- for now, be sure to skip to the
[OpenHotfixLoader](/bl3-running-mods/#ohl-openhotfixloader) section.

For aspiring mod authors, check out the [Writing Wonderlands Mods](/wl-writing-mods/)
section.  You'll find that the process is essentially identical to BL3 mods,
so if you're already familiar with that, you'll feel right at home.

As always, if you need help with Wonderlands modding (or with BL2/TPS/BL3 modding),
join the modding support discord: <https://discord.gg/bXeqV8Ef9R>

Happy modding!
