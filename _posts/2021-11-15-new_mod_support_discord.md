# New Mods Support Discord Opened

It's been nearly a year since Borderlands 3 modding was introduced to
the community at large, and it's been a pretty crazy time!  Our
[ModCabinet wiki](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/wiki) has exploded
with a lot of fun mods, and we're still discovering new methods and
techniques to bend the game to our collective will.

Shadow's Evil Hideout had long been one of the main hubs of this kind
of Borderlands modding, but now Shadowevil's started up a new Discord
server for Mods support for all Borderlands games: 1, 2, TPS, 3, and
even the recently-released standalone Assault on Dragon Keep.  If you're
having any problems with mods on any of the Borderlandses, feel free
to stop on by!

The invite link to **Borderlands Mods Support**: <https://discord.gg/bXeqV8Ef9R>

Enjoy!  Our [community page](/community/) does, of course, still list
a number of other Borderlands modding communities on the internet.
